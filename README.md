# General Description of this Repository

This repository is dedicated to my senior project for my bachelor's degree in physics. The project focuses on developing a machine learning model that could identify the correlations between outflow state of a galaxy and various physical properties of a galaxy. Most of the code in this project is written in `python` and separated in each `.ipynb` files. The data is obtained from the official webpage of VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS).
